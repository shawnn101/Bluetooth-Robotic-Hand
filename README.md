# Bluetooth-Robotic-Hand

The Wireless Robotic Hand project aims to develop an assistive device designed to help hospital patients suffering from nerve damage or hand mobility issues. Utilizing flex sensors, Arduino programming, and wireless communication, the robotic hand will mimic the movements of a healthy hand, providing patients with a means to perform everyday tasks with greater ease and independence.
